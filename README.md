# E06a-Particles-and-Screen-Shake

This is an exercise completed for MSCH-G220 Game Technology as an introductory module to GODOT's Particle2D node system, as well as how to implement screen shake.

Players may shake the screen via the WASD keys to shake the camera up, down, left, or right.

3 Particles were chosen at random from free assets to attempt to recreate in GODOT. From left to right, here are the particles attempted within this exercise:

1 - "God Rays"/Lighting Rays
2 - Lightning/Lighting Storm
3 - Rain/Sleet


As always, have fun!
